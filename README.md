### Hi there, I am Qian!

- I am a third-year CS Ph.D. candidate at National University of Singapore, fortunately supervised by Prof. Bingsheng He. My research interests lie in LLM Multi-Agent Systems, LLM safety, and cryptocurrency now.
- I have several papers accepted by top conferences/journals. First author: ICLR * 1, EMNLP * 1, ACL * 1; Others: NeurIPS * 1, ACM Computing Survey * 1, TKDE * 1. I am pushing myself to write and submit high-quality papers to top conferences every three months. 
- My personal website is at https://persdre.github.io/.
- How to reach me: You can drop me emails at persdre@gmail.com
- I am a typical ENTP. So, I am willing to talk and collaborate with people. I enjoy research as this community hosts many people similar to me so I can make friends here.
