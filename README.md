Your authorship position—either first or second author—will be determined by the level of your contribution. If interested, please reach out as soon as possible.
- I am a second-year CS Ph.D. candidate at National University of Singapore, fortunately supervised by Prof. Bingsheng He. My research interests lie in LLM agents, LLM reasoning and interpretability, and cryptocurrency now. I won research achievement award this year by NUS.
